In this project, we delve into a comprehensive dataset encapsulating recent and historical U.S. energy statistics. This reservoir of information encompasses facets like total energy production, consumption, stocks, trade, prices, and more across various energy sources.\nIn navigating this dataset, several compelling questions emerge:\n\nUnveiling Energy Trends: Understanding the evolving consumption of varied energy sources, spanning fossil fuels to renewables, is vital. These trends unveil crucial shifts in demand and usage patterns, painting a narrative of America’s energy preferences.\nBalancing Production and Consumption: The synergy between energy production and consumption is vital for sustainable ecosystems. Analyzing this dynamic reveals insights into whether production growth aligns with consumption, crucial for future energy security and sustainability.\nPrice Dynamics and Supply-Demand: Price fluctuations in varied energy sources often mirror intricate supply-demand dynamics. How have the prices of these resources evolved? Are these changes intricately linked to shifts in supply or demand patterns?\nRenewable Energy’s impact on Conventional Sources: The rise of renewable energy prompts an inquiry, does its increasing share catalyze a substitution effect on traditional energy sources such as coal and oil?\nCarbon Emissions and Energy Mix: How do different energy sources correlate with U.S. carbon emissions? Does the integration of renewable sources influence carbon footprint reduction?\n\nThrough an exploratory analysis, this project aims to navigate the wealth of data within this comprehensive dataset, utilizing visualization and analytical techniques to decipher patterns, trends, and interdependencies within the U.S. energy sphere. By delving into these queries, we aim to present a holistic portrayal of the multifaceted aspects defining America’s energy panorama."

Utilizing a line graph, the annual average values of Fossil Energy Consumption, Renewable Energy Consumption, and Total Energy Consumption are depicted, revealing the overall changes in US energy consumption over the past thirty years.\n\n\nCode\nconsumption_30y &lt;- subset(consumption, year &gt;= 1993 & year &lt;= 2023)\nconsumption_30y_total &lt;- subset(consumption_30y, select = c(1, 5, 12, 13))\ncolnames(consumption_30y_total) &lt;- c(\"Year\", \"Fossil\", \"Renewable\", \"Total\")\n\nconsumption_melted &lt;- melt(consumption_30y_total, id.vars = \"Year\", variable.name = \"Energy_Type\", value.name = \"Consumption\")\n\nggplot(consumption_melted, aes(x = Year, y = Consumption, color = Energy_Type, group = Energy_Type)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Consumption\", title = \"Energy Consumption Trends Over Years\")\n\n\n$x\n[1] \"Year\"\n\n$y\n[1] \"Consumption\"\n\n$title\n[1] \"Energy Consumption Trends Over Years\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"labels\"\n\n\nFrom the graph, it’s evident that the total energy consumption in the US is still dominated by traditional Fossil fuels, while Renewable energy shows an upward trend since the late twentieth century.\nAs the total energy consumption in the United States continues to be predominantly reliant on traditional Fossil fuels, we will now focus on analyzing Fossil energy. Fossil energy primarily comprises three components: coal, petroleum, and natural gas.\nDrawing a stacked histogram reveals the changing trends in US Fossil energy consumption over the past thirty years.

Following Petroleum is Gas, which has shown a steady increase in consumption year by year. The smallest proportion is attributed to Coal, which exhibits a declining consumption trend over the same period.\n\n\nCode\nconsp_date$Year &lt;- year(consp_date$Month)\nconsp_date$Month &lt;- month(consp_date$Month)\n\nconsp_date2 &lt;- consp_date %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -c(\"Month\", \"Year\"), names_to = \"TYPE\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(TYPE = forcats::fct_reorder2(TYPE, Month, value))\n\n\nLastly, we aim to investigate whether energy consumption is associated with seasonal variations, such as higher demands for heating during cold winters and increased cooling needs in hot summers, both leading to escalated energy consumption.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(consp_date2, mapping = aes(x = Year, y = value, colour = TYPE)) +\n  geom_line() + geom_point(size = 1) + \n  labs(x = \"Month\", y = \"Energy Consumption\", title = \"Monthly Fossil Consumption Over Time\") +\n  facet_grid(~Month) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nHence, employing time series analysis, we extracted the changes in Fossil fuel consumption over the past thirty years for each month.\nThe results from the graph indicate that in comparison to other months, Fossil fuel consumption is notably higher in December and January, as well as in July and August. This aligns with our assumptions regarding seasonal trends."

There was a significant surge from 1993 to 2008, followed by fluctuations after 2008.\nAs for gas prices, various types exhibit similar changing patterns, witnessing a substantial increase from 1993 to 2008. However, there’s a noticeable difference in the values of different prices. Among these, the price of gas delivered to residential users is the highest. Possible reasons for this include:\n\nResidential users typically have a stable and indispensable demand for natural gas, particularly for heating and cooking. This relatively fixed demand allows natural gas suppliers to set relatively higher prices.\nSupplying natural gas to residential areas may involve more pipelines and infrastructure, with additional logistics and investment costs that might be factored into user prices.\nProviding natural gas services to residential users might require more service support and guarantees, such as ensuring continuous supply and handling emergency situations. These additional services might contribute to the increased prices.\n\nNext, we aim to investigate whether the prices of oil and gas, being primary energy sources, are influenced by the supply and demand of energy.\nWe selected energy production, energy imports, and changes in energy stock as energy supply indicators. For oil prices, considering the close resemblance among the six types of oil prices, we opted to use the average of these six prices as the representative oil price. Concerning gas prices, we chose the initial price, specifically the price at the urban distribution point, as our reference.\nWe aim to construct a scatter plot to explore the relationship between energy supply, energy consumption, oil price, and gas price.\n\n\nCode\nprice.vs.supply.demand &lt;- merge(prod.vs.consp2, oil_price_y, by = 'Year')\nprice.vs.supply.demand &lt;- merge(price.vs.supply.demand, gas_price_y, by = 'Year')\n\nprice.vs.supply.demand$Supply &lt;- price.vs.supply.demand$Production + price.vs.supply.demand$Import + price.vs.supply.demand$Storage.Change\n\nprice.vs.supply.demand &lt;- price.vs.supply.demand %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  mutate(Oil_Price = mean(c_across(6:11), na.rm = TRUE))\n\ncorr.price.vs.supply.demand &lt;- price.vs.supply.demand %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(Supply, Consumption, Oil_Price, Citygate)\n\nplot(corr.price.vs.supply.demand)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph, it’s evident that there’s an unmistakable linear relationship between supply and consumption. The prices of oil and gas show a proportional correlation with the supply and demand of energy.\n\n\nCode\ntotal_pro_consp &lt;- subset(total_m, select = c(1, 5, 8, 9, 13), Month &gt;= '1993-01-01')\ncolnames(total_pro_consp) &lt;- c(\"Month\", \"Primary.Pro\", \"Import\", \"Stock\", \"Consumption\")\noil_price &lt;- subset(oil_price, Month &gt;= '1993-01-01')\ngas_price &lt;- subset(gas_price, Month &gt;= '1993-01-01')\n\ntotal_price_pro_consp &lt;- merge(total_pro_consp, oil_price, by = 'Month')\ntotal_price_pro_consp &lt;- merge(total_price_pro_consp, gas_price, by = 'Month')\n\ntotal_price_pro_consp &lt;- total_price_pro_consp %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  mutate(Oil_Price = mean(c_across(6:11), na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntotal_price_pro_consp$Supply &lt;- total_price_pro_consp$Primary.Pro + total_price_pro_consp$Import + total_price_pro_consp$Stock\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(total_price_pro_consp, aes(Supply, Oil_Price)) + \n  geom_hex() +\n  ggtitle(\"Energy Supply vs Oil Price\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(total_price_pro_consp, aes(Consumption, Oil_Price)) + \n  geom_hex() +\n  ggtitle(\"Energy Demand vs Oil Price\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(total_price_pro_consp, aes(Supply, `Natural.Gas.Price,.Citygate`)) + \n  geom_hex() +\n  ggtitle(\"Energy Supply vs Gas Price\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(total_price_pro_consp, aes(Consumption, `Natural.Gas.Price,.Citygate`)) + \n  geom_hex() +\n  ggtitle(\"Energy Demand vs Gas Price\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a heatmap depicting the relationship between monthly energy supply and demand along with oil and gas prices, we observe that the energy supply and demand are concentrated around the 7th and 8th months, coinciding with gas prices concentrated between 2.5 and 6.\nIn contrast, the heatmap depicting the relationship between oil price and supply and demand doesn’t show a clear trend. This might be due to significant fluctuations in oil prices over the last thirty years. There are likely other factors that exert a more significant influence on oil prices, such as political factors, resulting in the lack of a distinct trend in the heatmap."

Overall, after 2010, both the production and consumption of new energy surpassed the levels from 1990 to 2010.\nFrom the perspective of different new energy types, after 2010 compared to the period between 1990 and 2010, there has been an increase in the production and consumption of geothermal, solar, and biomass energy. This discovery aligns with our understanding of technological progress.\nAdditionally, there has been a decrease in the consumption of wood and waste. The likely reason for this reduction is that the primary method of energy production from wood and waste involves combustion processes that generate a significant amount of carbon dioxide. Consequently, these methods of producing energy from wood and waste are gradually being replaced.\nThe following code is used to generate the dataset used for the interactive plot.\n\n\nCode\nconsumption &lt;- yearlyenergy[, c(\"Year\", \"Total Fossil Fuels Consumption\", \"Nuclear Electric Power Consumption\", \"Total Renewable Energy Consumption\")]\nconsumption &lt;- consumption |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = 2:4, names_to = \"Type\", values_to = \"Consumption\")\n\nconsumption_scaled &lt;- yearlyenergy[, c(\"Year\", \"Scaled Fossil Fuels Consumption\", \"Scaled Renewable Energy Consumption\", \"Scaled Nuclear Electric Power Consumption\")]\ncolnames(consumption_scaled) &lt;- c(\"Year\", \"Total Fossil Fuels Consumption\", \"Nuclear Electric Power Consumption\", \"Total Renewable Energy Consumption\")\nyearlyconsumption &lt;- consumption_scaled |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = 2:4, names_to = \"Type\", values_to = \"Scaled Consumption\") |&gt; \n  right_join(consumption, by = c(\"Year\", \"Type\"))\n\nyearlyconsumption_sorted &lt;- yearlyconsumption |&gt; \n  arrange(Type %in% c(\"Total Renewable Energy Consumption\", \"Nuclear Electric Power Consumption\", \"Total Fossil Fuels Consumption\"), Type)\nyearlyconsumption_sorted$Consumption &lt;- format(yearlyconsumption_sorted$Consumption, digits = 5)\nyearlyconsumption_sorted$`Scaled Consumption` &lt;- format(yearlyconsumption_sorted$`Scaled Consumption`, digits = 5)\nwrite.csv(yearlyconsumption_sorted, \"Yearly Consumption.csv\", row.names=FALSE)"

    "text": "Our investigation delved into various facets of the energy landscape, focusing on consumption trends, production-consumption balance, price dynamics, the impact of renewable energy on conventional sources, and carbon emissions’ relation to the energy mix. The results are as follows:\n\nUnveiling Energy Trends: There is a consistent dominance of traditional fossil fuels in the U.S. energy consumption patterns, although renewable energy showcased a rising trend post the 20th century.\nBalancing Production and Consumption: We identified the relationship between energy production and consumption, exploring the impact of energy imports and stock change on the overall supply. Over the last three decades, U.S. has heavily relied on domestic energy production, with a decline in net import, even reaching a net surplus.\nPrice Dynamics and Supply-Demand: By analyzing the fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices, we analyzed why residential and commercial gas prices tend to be relatively higher. Furthermore, a positive proportional relationship exists between energy prices and supply-demand dynamics.\nRenewable Energy Impact on Conventional Sources: We compared the proportions and trends of new vs traditional energy. Solar, geothermal, and biomass energy have seen increased production and consumption, aligning with technological advancements. Conversely, consumption of wood and waste energy has decreased, possibly due to the environmental impacts associated with their combustion-based production.\nCarbon Emissions and Energy Mix: The correlation between fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions is notably high, indicating that reducing fossil fuel consumption could significantly mitigate carbon emissions. Fossil fuels remained primary contributors to \\(CO2_\\) emissions. Unexpectedly, Motor Gasoline and Distillate Fuel also constituted a substantial proportion of emissions."
