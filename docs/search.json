    "text": "1 Introduction\nEnergy is the lifeblood of modern civilization, and understanding its dynamics is paramount for sustainable development. In this project, we delve into a comprehensive dataset encapsulating recent and historical U.S. energy statistics. This reservoir of information encompasses facets like total energy production, consumption, stocks, trade, prices, and more across various energy sources.\nIn navigating this dataset, several compelling questions emerge:\n\nUnveiling Energy Trends: Understanding the evolving consumption of varied energy sources, spanning fossil fuels to renewables, is vital. These trends unveil crucial shifts in demand and usage patterns, painting a narrative of America’s energy preferences.\nBalancing Production and Consumption: The synergy between energy production and consumption is vital for sustainable ecosystems. Analyzing this dynamic reveals insights into whether production growth aligns with consumption, crucial for future energy security and sustainability.\nPrice Dynamics and Supply-Demand: Price fluctuations in varied energy sources often mirror intricate supply-demand dynamics. How have the prices of these resources evolved? Are these changes intricately linked to shifts in supply or demand patterns?\nRenewable Energy’s impact on Conventional Sources: The rise of renewable energy prompts an inquiry, does its increasing share catalyze a substitution effect on traditional energy sources such as coal and oil?\nCarbon Emissions and Energy Mix: How do different energy sources correlate with U.S. carbon emissions? Does the integration of renewable sources influence carbon footprint reduction?\n\nThrough an exploratory analysis, this project aims to navigate the wealth of data within this comprehensive dataset, utilizing visualization and analytical techniques to decipher patterns, trends, and interdependencies within the U.S. energy sphere. By delving into these queries, we aim to present a holistic portrayal of the multifaceted aspects defining America’s energy panorama."

The lack of data in this part may be related to the level of technological development at that time, when new energy power generation was not popular. The lack of popularization of new energy power generation directly leads to the lack of data on new energy consumption."
