# Conclusion

Our investigation delved into various facets of the energy landscape, focusing on consumption trends, production-consumption balance, price dynamics, the impact of renewable energy on conventional sources, and carbon emissions' relation to the energy mix. The results are as follows:

1.  **Unveiling Energy Trends:** There is a consistent dominance of traditional fossil fuels in the U.S. energy consumption patterns, although renewable energy showcased a rising trend post the 20th century.
2.  **Balancing Production and Consumption:** We identified the relationship between energy production and consumption, exploring the impact of energy imports and stock change on the overall supply. Over the last three decades, U.S. has heavily relied on domestic energy production, with a decline in net import, even reaching a net surplus.
3.  **Price Dynamics and Supply-Demand:** By analyzing the fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices, we analyzed why residential and commercial gas prices tend to be relatively higher. Furthermore, a positive proportional relationship exists between energy prices and supply-demand dynamics.
4.  **Renewable Energy Impact on Conventional Sources:** We compared the proportions and trends of new vs traditional energy. Solar, geothermal, and biomass energy have seen increased production and consumption, aligning with technological advancements. Conversely, consumption of wood and waste energy has decreased, possibly due to the environmental impacts associated with their combustion-based production.
5.  **Carbon Emissions and Energy Mix:** The correlation between fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions is notably high, indicating that reducing fossil fuel consumption could significantly mitigate carbon emissions. Fossil fuels remained primary contributors to $CO2_$ emissions. Unexpectedly, Motor Gasoline and Distillate Fuel also constituted a substantial proportion of emissions.
