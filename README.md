This project aims to dissect a comprehensive dataset encompassing various U.S. energy statistics, including production, consumption, trade, and prices across different energy sources. It embarks on understanding consumption trends, balancing production with consumption, examining price dynamics aligned with supply and demand, assessing the impact of renewable energy on traditional energy sources, and investigating the correlation between energy mix and U.S. carbon emissions. Utilizing exploratory analysis techniques, the project visualizes and analyzes these facets, aiming to offer a holistic view of America's energy landscape and its future trajectories.
